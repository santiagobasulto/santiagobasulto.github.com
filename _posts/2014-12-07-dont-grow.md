YCombinator's [How to Start a Startup](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/) course was great from start to end. Paul Graham's ["Before the Startup"](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec03/) class was one of the ones I enjoyed the most. Paul talks about the counterintuitive nature of startups. One thing I loved from his lecture can be summarized with this quote:

> What you need to succeed in a startup is **not** expertise in startups. (...) What you need to know to succeed in a startup is **expertise in your own users**.

That's the kind of advise you hear from your parents when you're young and you just say. "Yeah, whatever, I know that." And you don't pay much attention. But then you come back 10 years later and say: "You were so right! How could I have missed that." And again, "Expertise in your own users" sounds so obvious that it seems stupid even to mention it. But Paul is not a stupid guy, he knows most entrepreneurs end up forgetting about it[1].

## Growth hacking == bullshit?

The title is inspired on something Paul says in that very same class:

> Whenever you hear somebody talk about Growth Hacks, just mentally translate it in your mind to "bullshit".

The quote caused some [discussion](https://growthhackers.com/questions/ask-gh-what-do-you-think-of-paul-grahams-comment-about-growth-hacking/) on the internet and also caused some people to be ofended. But I think Paul wasn't trying to say that "Growth Hacking is bullshit" but **if someone talks to you about Growth Hacking when you're starting your startup, he/she might be either a thief or a complete moron.**[2]. The truth is that when you're starting your startup [you should focus on the right thing](http://www.feld.com/archives/2013/11/focus-focus-focus.html), and that's not growing (or hacking your growth), the right thing to focus on is: [**making your users happy.**](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/504341571345866752)

## Focus on the right thing

I think we all agree at this point that making your users happy is the number one thing to focus on. Yet, we constantly see how new founders and entrepreneurs focus on "how to get 50k followers on twitter" or "how to get featured on product hunt", etc. That's the **biggest mistake you can make: focusing on "growing" something that's not yet great for your users**.

I hope you're familiarized with Dave McClure's [Startup Metrics for Pirates](http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version) (if you aren't please leave everything and just read those slides 1000 times). The framework Dave introduces is the following:

![Pirate Metrics](/img/posts/2014-12-07-dont-grow/pirate-metrics-1.png)

I think it's pretty self-explanatory; you pick one metric for each step of the funnel and then you try to improve it as much as you can. With each new step the amount of users/customers will decrease. Eg\[3\] (top-down, acquisition-referal):

* You acquire 100 users (landing page visit)
* 70 get activated (complete registration)
* 30 keep coming back (make a product search at least every 1 month)
* 10 generate revenue (buy something)
* 3 refer to a friend.

People (including myself) always tend to start with the acquisition metric(s). It's at the top of the funnel, it's one of the most exciting ones (come on! how many times you've heard someone bragging: "yeah, we have 100k visits per month". We all want to be able to brag about that!) and usually it's the easiest metric to define. But when you're starting, acquisition is the least important phase and you shouldn't spend any resources on it. **Your primary focus should be on retention (and maybe revenue), not in acquisition or activation.** Those are things that can be tunned in the future, once you're sure that your product is inherently great. Even more, it'll be the easiest things to tune and to improve once you know that you have an awesome product.

## Getting users is easy

Getting users in order to build a great product is an easy task; because you don't need that many. Usually the amount of users needed to test your product and to improve it on the first stages is less than 100. And that's an easy to get number without the need of "growth hacking" techniques. **Just get outside of your office and get the damn users**. They are at the reach of your hand, you can easily talk to 100 users (usually it's less than 100) in 1 month and convince them to try/use your product. Trust me, you don't need 100.000 users to make your startup "viable". It's common to hear people building social networks complaining about the "network effect" they need before they can actually get something going. They're lying to themselves. They're just avoiding the hard true, which is: **they're building a shitty product or they're too afraid to start building one**. How did Mark Zuckemberg started? Did he had 1B users when he got started? No! Of course not. He started with a small set of people from Hardvard University (his own university, one he had access to and happened to know the people and the culture in it). Once he was sure the product was good enough to make the next step he took it to other universities, one step at a time, until they covered most of US universities. Once that phase was complete then he focused on bringing Facebook to the mainstream public. And even then Facebook wasn't focused on 100% of the population. Today even my mother has a Facebook account (damn you Zuckemberg!), but back in the day it was a clearly targeted product.

Seriously, **you don't need 50k followers or 100k visits per month to create a great product.**. It surely doesnt't hurt to have them. But if having/acquiring those is consuming resources (even minimal), then you're making a huge mistake.

## Coda

I want to finish this post with a phrase that has always cought my eye and happens to be the one present in YCombinator's website footer, I think it's a good and simple summary of how to create a successful bussines, yet it's really hard to realize and remember: **Make something people want**.

* [1] I've made that same mistake several times, and still haven't learnt it.
* [2] I might be wrong. Sorry for the wild guess.
* [3] Numbers are made up and far from reallity.
