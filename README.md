I've borrowed the source code from Josh Suereth [https://github.com/jsuereth/jsuereth.github.com/](https://github.com/jsuereth/jsuereth.github.com/). Thank you Josh for making that public.

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

Thanks to Tom Preston-Werner for making this possible!
